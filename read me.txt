If you want exact balances in the Python runs, please adjust the 'math_prog_imes'. 
If you want least cost, keep it as is. 

On line 226, change the <= to a ==, this means the main balance constraint becomes an equality, instead of an inequality. 
CURRENT CODE (inequality)
model.Demand[energy_type, location, time_period] <=\

ADJUST FOR EXACT BALANCE (equality)
model.Demand[energy_type, location, time_period] ==\
